# Overview

## Description

- `cgpt` is a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) tool that allows you to use AI directly in your favorite Terminal.
- `cgpt` is based on [CLICK](https://github.com/pallets/click) for creating beautiful command line interfaces in a composable way.

##  Prerequisities

- python >=3.10
- openai API KEY :
  You need to register on openai to receive your own api key , here : [api_key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

  > This tool is still using `gpt-3.5-turbo` 
  > `gpt-4` and `gpt-4-turbo` are on the way. ðŸ˜‰

###  Run with docker 

Pull the image 
```
$ docker pull ainayves/cgpt:latest
```

Run the docker image by using your openai api key :

```
$ docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY="yourapikey" -i -t ainayves/cgpt
```

### Use it inside a local network

You can also use cgpt inside a LAN thanks to the command : `cgpt --lan` .

- You just need one Host (`connected to internet`) to be the server.
- Other Hosts (`not connected to internet`) can ALWAYS use the AI as `client`.

To run the LAN mode in docker :

```
$ docker run -e OPENAI_API_KEY="yourapikey" -i -t ainayves/cgpt:latest poetry run cgpt --lan
```

#### Note

> For now, the server must be launched inside a `Linux` computer. If the server is running on `Windows`, the address may sometimes be > incorrect (to be fixed in the next version). Additionally, ensure that your `/etc/hosts` file is configured correctly as follows :
> ```
> 127.0.0.1	localhost
> 127.0.1.1	your-hostanme
> ```
> A `client` can also use his own api_key on future releases.
